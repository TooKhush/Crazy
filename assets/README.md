Place the provided logo image file here and name it `logo.png`.

Recommended steps:
1. Create an `assets` folder in the project root if it doesn't exist.
2. Save the attached logo image as `assets/logo.png`.
3. The site already references this image in the nav and footer (`<img src="assets/logo.png" ...>`).

Optional: If you want the logo to be circular, use an image at least 512x512 and it will be shown with `rounded-full` and `object-cover` classes.
